# Creating Scrappy Apps for MVPs and Hackathons

>&nbsp;
> _Just Enough App To Get The Job Done!_
>&nbsp;

## Aims

* Learn how to create a browser based app that:

 * Runs nicely on mobile device web browsers
 * Looks like a mobile app
 * Has key functionality
 * Lets you perform deeper user validation than possible


* The course will teach:

 * some very basic HTML5+CSS - and where to find out more
 * some basic javascript - and where to find out more
 * some basic data handling - and where to find out more
 * not to be afraid of experimentation
 * examples of sticking software libraries together like Lego

## This is not a computer science or programming course!

Beware!
* This course will not teach you how to be a programmer
* This course will not teach you how to think like a programmer
* This course would make professional developers cringe!

But remember why you are here:
* You have an idea or a project
* You need to solve a problem
* You have skills in other areas or specialties

You are learning a "duct tape and string" approach to building just enough
web app to do what you need to do - a means to an end...

You will be frustrated though, if you are not also able to treat this as a starting
point and learn how to use resources such as the
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)* to learn more.

_(* This reference may have some coders sneering, because as well as being
  a huge resource for professional developers, the site is also frequented
  by less-than competent developers and kids trying to find others to do their
  homework... just ignore the sneers!)_  

## Course Preparation

* You need a text editor. On Windows, [Atom](https://atom.io/) will get the job done.
  If you are running Linux you probably already have that sorted.
  On a Mac, you might be able to teach me...
* You need Internet access to run the demos. (Some _may_ work on your laptop without it)
* You need Firefox or Chrome on your laptop. I haven't tested the demos on other browsers
* A mobile device is handy but optional.
  We will use the browser responsive developer mode to check mobile device rendering.
  But you should always test your app on a selection of mobile devices. Or at least,
  an Android and an iOS device, because there will be quirks to deal with.

## Homework

The homework each week is essential, especially if you have never done any
computer programming or HTML before.
if you don't at least attempt it you will get way behind in the the next week.

It is more than OK to try the homework and not succeed, as long as you try!
This will give use something to focus on the next lesson.

The course is intentionally run with small class sizes, and after the first week
the material is tailored around the kind of app you might be thinking of building.

## Limitations of MVPs created by methods taught in this Course

You *must* understand the following restrictions!

* They need an Internet connection - all third party libraries and CSS are
  downloaded from CDN (content distribution networks). Learning how to structure
  a web app with your own hosted third party libraries is beyond the scope of
  this Course

* They wont be pretty, although with a little bit of effort you can make them tidy.
  Hire a designer to gain some improvements; but to it will take a lot of practice
  and further study to gain the skills needed to actually implement good design techniques

* They wont be scalable. Only the simplest or crappiest of apps will keep working
  with only a HTML, CSS and JS file. Any code with any complexity requires
  modularity and many other facets of software engineering which are definitely
  not being taught within the scope of this course. I will do tuition...

* The data wont be scalable. The google firebase is just used because for small
  data it is free and it is a quick and easy way to learn about saving
  and loading data.

* They wont run on the app store. but you knew that before we started.

* They wont be secure. There is too much background knowledge required to do
  that properly. There are entire courses possible just on securing individual
  _subsystems_ of apps...

* They will probably break if used in any way other than the obvious. because
  both CSS and javascript are very easy to make mistakes in, and hard to debug,
  especially for novices. But they are also easy to learn and be quite productive
  for novices. So they get the job done.
  But breaking is OK provided the main function works. This is an MVP, and the idea is to make something functional
  to learn about your customers.
