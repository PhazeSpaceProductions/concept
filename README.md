# Creating Scrappy Apps for MVPs

>
> Just Enough App To Get The Job Done

## Course Preparation

* You need a text editor. On Windows, https://atom.io/ will get the job done. If you are running Linux you probably already have that sorted. On a Mac, you might be able to each me... 
* You need Internet access to run the demos.
* You need Firefox or Chrome on your laptop

## Homework

The homework each week is essential, if you don't at least attempt it you will get way
behind in the the next week. But is is more than OK to try the homework and
not succeed, as long as you try!

## Limitations of MVPs created using methods of this Course

* They need an Internet connection - all third party libraries and CSS are
  downloaded from CDN (content distribution networks). Learning how to structure
  a web app with your own hosted third party libraries is beyond the scope of
  this Course

* They wont be pretty, although with a little bit of effort you can make them tidy.
  Hire a designer to gain some improvements; but to it will take a lot of practice
  and further study to gain the skills needed to actually implement good design techniques

* They wont be scalable. Only the simplest or crappiest of apps will keep working
  with only a HTML, CSS and JS file. Any code with any complexity requires
  modularity and many other facets of software engineering which are definitely
  not being taught within the scope of this course. I will do tuition...

* The data wont be scalable. The google firebase is just used because for small
  data it is free and it is a quick and easy way to learn about saving
  and loading data.

* They wont run on the app store. but you knew that before we started.

* They wont be secure. There is too much background knowledge required to do
  that properly. There are entire courses possible just on securing individual
  _subsystems_ of apps...

* They will probably break if used in any way other than the obvious. because
  both CSS and javascript are very easy to make mistakes in, and hard to debug,
  especially for novices. But they are also easy to learn and be quite productive
  for novices. So they get the job done.
  But breaking is OK provided the main function works. This is an MVP, and the idea is to make something functional
  to learn about your customers.
