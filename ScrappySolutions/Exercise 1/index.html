<title>Just Enough Scrappy Apps - Simple HTML / CSS Example</title>

<!-- Note we skip the purecss CSS here, we dont use it so dont waste time loading it -->

<h1>Hello, world</h1>

<section class="my-section">
<p>
  This is a simple web application.
  <br/>
  In fact it is really just a web page, but with layout constraints that
  force it to display like a phone app would.
  If this is all you really need,  you should just use <a href="https://www.weebly.com/au" target="_newTab">Weebly</a>
  or <a href="https://apps.google.com/products/sites/" target="_newTab">Google Sites</a> or some other tool.
  <br/>
  What this does provide though, is a base for building an MVP app from.
</p>
<p>
  You can copy the files to any web host and it should work.
</p>
<p class="my-paragraph">
  This is an example of css formatting - from class 'my-paragraph' in 'index.css'
</p>
<div class="my-paragraph">
  The same CSS applies to all elements with the same class. This is a div not a p.
</p>
<div class="my-paragraph" id="my-item" >
  This is an example of css formatting - from id 'my-item'
  Note the font is smaller because &lt;div&gt; has a different size from &lt;P&gt;
  <br/>To use special characters like <span class="emph">&lt;</span>, you need entities. They start with <span class="emph">&amp;</span>.
  A good starting point is the <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref" target="_newTab">HTML5 Charref</a>
</div>
