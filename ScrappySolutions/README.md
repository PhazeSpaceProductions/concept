This means if you use these as a starting point, you need to retain the
copyright attribution to Phaze Space Productions Pty Ltd.

So when you create your own app, you are likely to better off starting with the
ScrappySkeleton template instead, and building up from scratch, because you will
likely want to retain IP or require a different license for your own app code.

Essentially, this means your own app should not end up as a 'derivative work'
of these examples. Pragmatically it means you can copy/paste and then modify bits
from here into the app you started from the skeleton, and its all good.

It also means, that anyone else wanting to use these examples in a training
course is required to acknowledge my original copyright.

Also, IANAL so seek your own advice!
